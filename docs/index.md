# Project Overview

It's a project base on ready to use components, so you don't need to do much to make yourself one.

## Hardware
For hardware description ytou can check [hardware description](./hardware.md).

## UI
Project UI uses LVGL editor, so if you have a different device display, all you need it to open `main/ui/lvgl_meteo` in the editor, and adjust the UI elements for you resolution.

If you don't know Ukrainian, you need to perform translation for fortune telling messages, and interface.
Unroftunately I don't have time to make it myself, but that shouldn't take too much time. For instructions see [i18n](./i18n.md) docs section.

## Design notes
If you want to make serious changes in the project, read [design notes](./design_notes.md) where I overview the most important components.

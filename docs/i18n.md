# Internationalization

At some point I may translate the app into English, but currently it uses Ukrainina for interface elements.

So, to translate you need to change several files:
1. `main/data/predictions.txt` contains fortune telling predictions (not sure how to call them properly). Use LLM to translate them.
2. `main/ui/lvgl_meteo/widgets/date/ms_date.c` contains days of the week mapping.
3. `main/ui/lvgl_meteo/screens/provisioning/provisioning_screen.xml` contains provisioning instructions.
4. `main/http_server/static/index.html` contains web page provisioning instructions.

That's all you need.
